# Taxi Fair

Aggregates taxi fares on several taxi-hailing applications and displays them in a centralised location, to avoid the hassle of comparing taxi fares across multiple apps every time you need a ride.

This app was built during [Hack&Roll 2023](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/), using React Native and several component libraries for several Google APIs, i.e. Places, Maps, and Destination APIs (see [package.json](package.json) for more details).

## Getting Started

1. Install pre-requisits of a normal React Native app (see https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`

3. Run `yarn start` and start your emulator of choice

4. Launch the app with the corresponding device platform with the Metro terminal (e.g. if you are using Android, press <kbd>a</kbd>)
